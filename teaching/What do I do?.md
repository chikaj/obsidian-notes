I am trying to investigate if there are more effective and accurate ways to assess drought risk in different geographical regions with GIS and remote sensing. While there is sufficient research out there on this topic, the accuracy of the prediction of the phenomenon of drought still did not hit the satisfactory mark due to the fact that much of this research could not integrate microclimatic situations and the models suffer greatly from these environmental factors and seasonal fluctuations. What I am trying to accomplish is to integrate all these factors into a new model using GIS and remote sensing approaches to develop a more efficient model of drought risk assessment and prediction.

- [It’s been very concise and clear. The study gap of previous study is mentioned. Although it looks fine to me how he/she explained it briefly, how he/she is integrating the factors that previous studies didn’t incorporate in their studies could be elaborated briefly]

My research project is about water justice in the global south. The water crisis is a worldwide issue and remains the risk of most profound concern for the whole world. It comes ahead of climate change, extreme weather events, food crises, and social instability. This crisis seems to be more aggravated in the global south. My objective is to analyze the factors that may create the discrepancy of safe drinking water distribution in Benin. What are the factors that influence water availability, how climate change affects water resources and how are the most exposed to water contamination? Those are the questions I would like to answer in my project. While reviewing the literature, I found out there are theorical concepts for the issues. However, those theories are not necessarily compatible with the situation in the global south. My contribution is to bring out the debate of water justice in the global south where it is absent.

- ("Hi Alain, I liked how you included all of your research questions that you are going to explore, also you explained it clearly how the theoretical approaches are not always applicable with the situation in the global south. I feel like if you compare water access and contamination issues in Benin with those in other countries in the global south, It would be helpful resource for you to identify unique factors that contribute to the water crisis in Benin and it has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field of water justice. GOODLUCK for your research."

The proliferation of data from smart cities has highlighted the need for a more comprehensive understanding of underlying urban mobility patterns and potential utilization opportunities. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a commonly used algorithm in urban dynamics studies due to its high tolerance for element displacement, however, the Community Detection algorithm, which overcomes the pairwise comparison limitations of DTW, has received relatively little attention. I plan to use an integrated framework that utilizes Bluetooth datasets to extract and compare mobility patterns using both DTW and Community Detection. By using Austin, Texas as a case study, my study aims to 1) identify the hourly spatial distribution of urban divisions during weekdays and weekends using DTW, 2) examine the daily and three-hour spatial distribution of urban divisions during weekdays and weekends using Community Detection, 3) Compare and contrast the spatial mobility distribution of urban divisions between the two methods.

- I think it's about Jinli's research work. She provided brief understanding about her intended research. But it would be better if she start like story telling. She should rearrage her first sentence with more easier words so that anyone can understand after first hearing. She should also mention the current state of her research. How much progress she has done. If DTW has limitations then why she is using it?

The majority of recent studies observed the accessibility and utilization of primary health care services compared to the accessibility and utilization of emergency departments. Hence, in my study, I will be observing the accessibility and utilization of emergency departments in the state of Texas.

The most utilized one is the Euclidean distance to estimate the distance of service facilities. However, people travel along roads having different speed limits for different roads. Therefore, considering the speed limit of different roads, travel time and distance between health facilities and patients I will determine the travel time to overcome the limitations of previous studies. Moreover, I would also like to consider proximity to primary and emergency health care services in regression analysis along with other sociodemographic variables which were not considered extensively in previous studies to evaluate which factors play a vital role. Furthermore, this study will be carried out having few specific local regions within the study area which will enable to examine how different factors differ across the regions. I hope this will help healthcare policymakers in their decision-making process.

Currently, I am conducting a study about a flood event that took place in

30–31 October 2013, which caused huge destruction in San Marcos City and its surrounding areas.

As a result, I'm concentrating on estimating the pre- and post-flood scenarios for San Marcos and floodplain condition of both the San Marcos River and the Blanco River's portion that flow over San Marcos City.

I am utilizing the Google Earth Engine platform to estimate the surface water change and also utilizing

the HEC-RAS software to evaluate the flood plain dynamics of both rivers. I have developed the JavaScript

to employ on the GEE platform. For satellite imagery, I am using Landsat 7 satellite images. I will use the CART algorithm for the image classification and accuracy assessment.

I have also gathered the daily stream flow data for certain dates so that I can figure out how the floodplain changes over time.

- (It has many topic-related jargon but I assume the overall objective of the research is not clear. For example, I understand the reason of using Google earth engine but the what kind of floodplain dynamics are studied by HEC-RAS is not clarified. Why is it relevant to study how floodplain changes? I think he/she can reflect on the study's implication of agriculture, communication, transportation, etc. by the effects of the flood event. )

I'm interested in studying the impact of natural disasters and hazards using GIS technology. Specifically, I'm focusing on how GIS can be used to model and visualize the impact of natural disasters on communities and to develop strategies to mitigate their effects.I'm also exploring how GIS can be used to help identify areas of high risk and vulnerability, and to develop strategies to reduce those risks and improve community resilience also i will be working on shape-files and estimated the hazard for various return periods and I'm excited to be part of this research.

- You stated what, and how, but there is no the where, or the why, the who are concerned or affected by...
- Also, I did not see a breve presentation of what others have written about the topic
- What will be your contribution to the body of literature?
- Is there any gap between what you find in the literature review and what you are trying to write about?
- You did not clearly specify which research question you are trying to answer.
