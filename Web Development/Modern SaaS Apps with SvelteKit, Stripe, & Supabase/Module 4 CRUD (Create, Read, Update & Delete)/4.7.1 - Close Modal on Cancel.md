# Hotfix!

If you notice when you try to delete a contact, the modal pops up. But when you clickÂ **No, Cancel**. The modal doesn't close, which shouldn't be the case.

To ensure it does close, let's update that button with the following:

`<Button color="alternative" on:click={() => (open = false)}>No, cancel</Button>`

Now you should be good to go!
